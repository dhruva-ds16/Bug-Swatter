Array initialization

var <VARNAME> [<LEN>]<ARRAY TYPE>

Example:
var a [6]int
a[0] = 6
i := a[0] //i = 6

Array variable denotes the entire array and not the first element

Arrays are strucures with indexed (fixed size) fields

Array Literals:

b := [2]string{"Hello", "World"}

or we can allow the compiler to count the number of elements in the array and set the size accordingly like this,

b := [...]string{"Hello", "World"} //here, the size is set to 2

Slices:

Slices are a more powerful and versatile variation of Arrays

Slices have no specified length.

Slice literals:

letters := []string{"a","b","c"}

A slice can be created using the built-in function called make

func make([]<Type>, <length>, <Capacity>) //Here capacity is optional

Example:
var s []byte
s = make([]byte, 5, 5) //Creates a slice with length 5 and max capacity of 5 with all zero values

When capacity field is omitted, it defaults to the length
